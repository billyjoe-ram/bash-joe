# Nice bash Scripts

## About

Hello there! Recently I installed a Linux distribution in my computer and I'm loving it! But man shall not live by nice GUI alone and I wanted to enjoy the most of my PC with this new environment; so some bash script must be learned.

There'll be some baby scrips, others simples but still nothing impressive and some more refined stuff. Follow the list to understand what's in this repository. All programs were base on the Ubuntu directory structure.

## What is bash script?
Well, acording to the GNU Project, bash (acronym for Bourne-Again Shell), is the GNU's shell, incorporating feature from Korn shell and C shell, offering improvements for programming and interactive use. (2020, Free Software Foundation). Just a tiny curiosity section for you guys.

  In this script, there is an interaction with the terminal, while it creates and edits a .txt file in your Desktop;
* Shutdown script
  It simply shutsdown your computer, if you are to lazy to press the button or wants to feel like a hacker;
